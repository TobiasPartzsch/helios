# Helios

Helios is a browser-based visualization of the heliocentric model and the sky as seen from Earth. It aims to show the positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon (and later other bodies) and render what an observer sees in the sky.

## Goals

- Model time internally using Julian Dates and sidereal time.
- Compute:
  - Sun position (RA/Dec, Alt/Az).
  - Moon position (RA/Dec, Alt/Az).
  - Basic Moon phases (illumination fraction).
- Render a simple sky view in a web browser, based on:
  - Observer location (latitude/longitude).
  - Date and time.

Planned features include:

- Adding more planets.
- A starfield or night-sky background.
- Importing a custom horizon silhouette (e.g. SVG).
- Visualizing phases of the Moon and eclipses.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Custom astronomy/math modules:
  - `core/time` – Julian Date and sidereal time.
  - `core/coordinates` – RA/Dec ↔ Alt/Az.
  - `core/bodies` – Sun and Moon positions and phases.
- Vitest for unit tests.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

(There is no full UI yet; the project currently focuses on the core calculations and tests.)

## Status
This project is a work in progress. The core time and coordinate transforms are in place, along with basic Sun and Moon models and tests. Rendering and UI are still to come.
